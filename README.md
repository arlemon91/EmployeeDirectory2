# EmployeeDirectory

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

Usage
--------------
The interactive app guides you into the homepage of the Employee Directory where you will see the entirety of 
all of the "employees". There are routes to direct you the homepage and search page where you can search the 
directory by State.


Installation
--------------
You can install EmployeeDirectory by using NPM.

```
npm install 
```

## Improvements
I need to figure out how to get the map function running on Search page. 
Adding CSS to stylize my page and get the heroku deployed correctly.
